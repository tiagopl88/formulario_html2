      <div class="content">
        <p>
          I went up to the arctic where I met a
          <strong id="animal1">polar bear</strong>. You might think she'd be
          white, but she had <strong id="color1">purple yellow</strong> hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hopped on to a <strong id="element1">glacier</strong> and I rode it
          out to sea. Snow is great for sledding but it's much too cold for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to go exploring places that I've never been. Take one step, and
          then another, that's how you begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made it to the jungle where a
          <strong id="animal2">toucan</strong> said "<strong id="greeting1"
            >Hello!</strong
          >" He made a hat from branches that he dropped to me below.
        </p>
        <p>
          High above in vines were where the lemurs liked to swing. They jumped
          around and laughed and that's when they began to sing:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<strong id="song"
            >We like to go exploring places that we've never been. Take one
            swing, and then another, that's how we begin.</strong
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          I <strong id="how">hiked up</strong> to the mountains where the bobcat
          had her band. The goats and mountain lions joined the song that they
          had planned:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<strong id="song2"
            >We like to go exploring places we have never been.</strong
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Take one step, and then another, that's how we begin. And if you don't
          believe the words I wrote inside this song, Take one step and then
          another, then go prove me wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, I love this story so much that I've already read it
          <strong id="quantity">10 </strong> times
        </p>
